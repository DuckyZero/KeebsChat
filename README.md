# KeebsChat
Mechanical Keyboard Chatbot, designed to enhance the keyboard community and help new comers learn more about this awesome hobby and promote local keyboard busniesses in Canada!

## How It Was Built:

This program was made with the programming language Python along with a few frameworks such as Tensorflow for creating and training neural networks, NLTK for tokenizing & stemming words and numpy to manage data. The full list of languages & frameworks are listed below:

* Python
* Tensorflow
* Tflearn
* NLTK
* Numpy

## Future Improvements:
Some of the future improvements/features I would add to this program are listed below:
* Create a flask web app for a greater user experience using the chatbot.
* Make a .exe file for users to directly download and use the program without to much setup needed.

## Updates:
- 6/18/2021 - Added a python webscraper program to scrape keyboard product info from https://www.apexkeyboards.ca/. This scraper will be necessary for the chatbot's main functionality.
- 7/09/2021 - Completed all functionality for the chatbot and fixed some errors in apexkeyboards webscraper, will be fixing up bugs and cleaning the code.
- 7/28/2021 - Code is cleaned and bugs are fixed. Will complete read me in the next few days
- 7/30/2021 - Finished the readme file, so the project is now complete.
