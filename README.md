# KeebsChat
Mechanical Keyboard Chatbot, designed to enhance the keyboard community and help new comers learn more about this awesome hobby and promote local keyboard busniesses in Canada!

## How It Was Built:

This program was made with the programming language Python along with a few frameworks such as Tensorflow for creating and training neural networks, NLTK for tokenizing & stemming words, Flask to provide a webpage for the chatbot and numpy to manage data. The full list of languages & frameworks are listed below:

* Python
* Tensorflow
* Tflearn
* Flask
* NLTK
* Numpy
* Json
* Pickle
* Beautifulsoup (bs4)
* HTML + CSS

## Future Improvements:
Some of the future improvements/features I would add to this program are listed below:
* Make a .exe file for users to directly download and use the program without to much setup needed.
* Talk to local computer keyboard businesses and try to implement the chatbot into their website.

## Updates:
- 6/18/2021 - Added a python webscraper program to scrape keyboard product info from https://www.apexkeyboards.ca/. This scraper will be necessary for the chatbot's main functionality.
- 7/09/2021 - Completed all functionality for the chatbot and fixed some errors in apexkeyboards webscraper, will be fixing up bugs and cleaning the code.
- 7/28/2021 - Code is cleaned and bugs are fixed. Next I will implement a Flask webpage to host KeebsChat.
- 8/28/2021 - I have finished the Flask webpage for the chatbot and now have completed this project. Yay!
